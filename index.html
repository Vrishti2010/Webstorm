In "Battle Royale", up to 20 three-person squads or 30 two-person duos land on an island and search for weapons and supplies before attempting to defeat all other players in combat. The available play area on the island shrinks over time, forcing players to keep moving or else find themselves outside the play area which can be fatal. The final team alive wins the round. In "Arenas", players form into three-player squads and fight against another squad in a 3v3 team deathmatch over a series of rounds to determine the winner of the match. Teams win when their team has at least 3 points and is 2 points ahead.

<img src="Victoria 3.jpg" class="images"> 
<br> <br> <br>
<p style="font-size: 19px;">The grand strategy titans of Paradox Interactive tend to stick with antiquity in their games. Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis are both set in the High Middle Ages — an age of kings and regents — where swaths of territory can change hands with a severed bloodline. But Victoria 3 shifts the parameters to the 19th century, where the stakes are a tad more relatable. You are given the controls of the commodity market at the dawn of globalization: managing an economy, organizing trade routes, and charting the political future of your people. Will you plunge the United States into socialist revolution? Grind the East India Trading Company to a halt? Reverse the forces of colonization in the heart of Africa? Victoria 3 gives us the world. Results may vary.
<br>  <br>
Victoria 3 was launched for PC via Steam and Microsoft Store on October 25 2022 for ₹4,091.46, publisher Paradox Interactive and developer Paradox Development Studio announced. It is also available via Xbox Game Pass for PC. The game is available in standard and “Grand” editions.

<h2> <b>1. <u> ELDEN RING</u> </b></h2>
<img src="elden ring.jpg" class="images"> 
<br> <br> <br>
<p style="font-size: 19px;"> If you recall the decaying gothic ramparts in Dark Souls, or the condemned Victorian hell of Bloodborne, then you already know that when FromSoftware is at its best, the studio creates some of the most iconic settings you’ll ever find in a video game. Elden Ring expanded on From’s tried-and-true formula — a dense, clockwork universe packed with furtive secrets and ecclesiastic lore — into, perhaps, the largest world ever rendered on a console. The Lands Between, where Elden Ring takes place, encompasses about 30 square miles of digital real estate. It takes a player three and a half hours to walk across its diameter, and they’ll find 157 unique boss fights across innumerable dungeons, alcoves, and temples along the way. FromSoftware took no shortcuts; every inch of this forsaken realm is authored and intentional, operating with a euphoric indifference toward the player. Will you find all of its secrets? Elden Ring could care less. You can play for hours before discovering a nondescript marble elevator that sinks down to a verdant underground river coursing, eternally, below our feet. The world map pleats open, revealing even more for us to chew on. Elden Ring's scale is a singular achievement.
<br>  <br>
Elden Ring can be played on wPlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. However Elden Ring is not a free game and its standard price is ₹4,909.91.
